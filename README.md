 # APSequence
## Basic Nucleotide Verification and Polypeptide Synthesis


### Running This Program

> *Make sure you have Haskell/GHC installed on your machine*

- Clone this repo to your machine using ```git clone https://github.com/WalkerRout/APSequence.git```
- In order to run this program, compile the file 'Sequence.hs' with ghc using the command ``` ghc -o Sequence Sequence.hs ```
- Run the executable created using the command ``` ./Sequence ``` (The '-o' flag in the ``` ghc ``` command dictates the name of the executable)
- This program takes in the **Sense** strand of a strand of DNA. Once a strand is input, the output will consist of a count of the bases on the corresponding mRNA strand along with the polypeptide chain of amino acids that the mRNA strand maps to.
