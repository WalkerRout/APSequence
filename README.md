# APSequence
## Basic Nucleotide Verification and Polypeptide Synthesis


### Running This Program

*Make sure you have Haskell installed on your machine*

- Clone this repo to your machine (you may have to delete the file labled 'Seq' with no extension located in the main directory, it is an OSX executable)
- In order to run this program, compile the file 'Sequence.hs' with ghc using the command ``` ghc -o Sequence Sequence.hs ```
- Run the executable created using the command ``` ./Sequence ``` (The '-o' flag in the ``` ghc ``` command dictates the name of the executable)
- This program takes in the **Sense** strand of a strand of DNA, and all of the nucleotides have to be in **all caps**
